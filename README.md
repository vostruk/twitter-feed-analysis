# twitter-feed-analysis
App that analyses social media (Twitter) feeds to identify the trending tourist  destinations in Asia or Europe

App is presented as Jupyter notebook.

The sample twitter stream data is located in /data directory. Data from twitter APIs “Spritzer” or “Sample” stream version was used which is a realtime stream of a random sample of 1% of all tweets

There are many things to improve in the app in future (mentioned in notebook)
